## Research
My main focus is on the coupling of live radiative transfer in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. Previously I have also worked on 3D molecular clouds simulations, doing a convergence study on the $X_{\rm CO}$ factor and $N_{\rm CO}$.

### Code development
I am a contributor to the smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics code [Phantom](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASA...35...31P/abstract) (publicly available via its [repository](https://github.com/danieljprice/phantom)) as well as the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code [MCFOST] (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A&A...459..797P) (now publicly available in the [repository] (https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost)).

### [On the rise times in FU Orionis events](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmpL.108B/abstract)
In 1936, an unremarkable star in the constellation of Orion, FU Ori, suddenly changed brightness by 6 magnitudes over the course of a year, remaining bright ever since. The phenomenon has since been observed in a number of outbursting young stars, which have been classed as FU Orionis. There has not been an explanation before as to the cause of this sudden outburst. 

Through the use of Phantom coupled with Mcfost, we created stellar flyby simulations and discovered that a disc penetrating stellar flyby results in the fast rise in the mass accretion,

Flyby scenarios had previously been discounted due the long time it takes for disturbances in the disc to propagate to the main star. Our simulations find the fast rise time expected with FU Orinis events with the perturber going into outburst. This happens as it captures the material from the disc while passing through. The perturber going into outburst is in line with observations from FU Ori, where the lower mass star is the brighter source in the binary system.
