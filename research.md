## Research
My main focus is on the coupling of live radiative transfer in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. Previously I have also worked on synthetic observations of 3D simulations of molecular clouds, doing a convergence study on the *X*co factor and *N*co.

### Code development
I am a contributor to the smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics code [<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Phantom</span>](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASA...35...31P/abstract) (publicly available via its [repository](https://github.com/danieljprice/phantom)) as well as the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code [<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mcfost</span>](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A&A...459..797P) (now publicly available in the [repository](https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost)).

### [On the rise times in FU Orionis events](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510L..37B/abstract)
In 1936, an unremarkable star in the constellation of Orion, FU Ori, suddenly changed brightness by 6 magnitudes over the course of a year, remaining bright ever since. The phenomenon has since been observed in a number of outbursting young stars, which have been classed as FU Orionis objects. There has not been an explanation before as to the cause of this sudden outburst. 

Through the use of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Phantom</span> coupled with <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mcfost</span>, we created stellar flyby simulations and discovered that a disc penetrating stellar flyby results in the fast rise in the mass accretion rate.

Flyby scenarios had previously been discounted due to the long time it takes for disturbances in the disc to propagate to the main star. Our simulations find the fast rise time associated with FU Orionis events with the perturber going into outburst. This happens as the perturber captures the material from the disc while passing through. The perturber going into outburst is in line with observations from FU Ori, where the lower mass star is the brighter source in the binary star system.

### [Sustained FU Orionis-type outbursts from colliding discs in stellar flybys](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.4436B/abstract)
We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of disc-disc stellar flybys with on-the-fly Monte Carlo radiative transfer. We show that pre-existing circumstellar discs around both stars result in fast rising (~yrs) outbursts lasting 2--5 times longer than for a star-disc flyby. The perturber always goes into outburst with the accretation rate exceeding 10<sup>-5</sup>solar mass/year. Whereas we find that the primary goes into a decades long outburst only when the flyby is retrograde to the circumprimary disc rotation. High accretion rates during the outburst are triggered by angular momentum cancellation in misaligned material generated by the encounter. A large fraction of accreted material is alien.

### [Synthetic CO emission and the *X*co factor of young molecular clouds: a convergence study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510..753B/abstract)
We performed synthetic observations on data from the SILCC-Zoom ins ([SImulating the LifeCycle of molecular Clouds](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454..238W/abstract), [Zoom-ins](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.472.4797S/abstract)) using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code [<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">radmc-3d</span>](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ascl.soft02015D/abstract) (available in this [repository](https://github.com/dullemond/radmc3d-2.0)). The zoom-ins had resolutions between 3.9 to 0.06 pc. With the synthetic emission maps we analysed the convergence of the CO emission and the *X*co factor, finding that both are not yet converged at the highest resolution of 0.06 pc. Furthermore, we also found that the *X*co factor from the synthetic observations of the observable region is below the commonly assumed value for the Milky Way.
